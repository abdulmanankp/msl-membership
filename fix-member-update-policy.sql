-- ===========================================

-- Add policy for admins to update members
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can update members" ON public.members;
CREATE POLICY "Admins can update members"
  ON public.members
  FOR UPDATE
  TO authenticated
  USING (public.has_role(auth.uid(), 'admin'))
  WITH CHECK (public.has_role(auth.uid(), 'admin'));

-- Add policy for admins to delete members
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can delete members" ON public.members;
CREATE POLICY "Admins can delete members"
  ON public.members
  FOR DELETE
  TO authenticated
  USING (public.has_role(auth.uid(), 'admin'));

-- Verify the policies are created
SELECT
  schemaname,
  tablename,
  policyname,
  permissive,
  roles,
  qual,
  with_check
FROM pg_policies
WHERE tablename = 'members'
ORDER BY policyname;
