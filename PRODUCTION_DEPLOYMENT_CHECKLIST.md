## Ongoing Development Workflow

### For Each Update

```bash
# 1. Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/description

# 2. Make changes in VS Code
# ... edit files ...

# 3. Test locally
npm run dev
npm run build

# 4. Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "feat: description of changes"
git push origin feature/description

# 5. Create Pull Request on GitHub
# Review changes → Merge to main

# 6. Hostinger auto-deploys ✅ (2-3 min)
# Production updated automatically
```

### Emergency Hotfix

```bash
# If critical bug in production
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Make fix
# ... edit files ...

# Push directly to main (skip PR)
git add .

## Troubleshooting Deployed App

### App Won't Start
```
Hostinger → Applications → Logs
Look for error messages
Common: Missing environment variable, dependency not installed
```

### Changes Not Live
```
Check:
1. Code pushed to main: git push origin main
2. Deployment successful: Hostinger → Deployment History
3. Hard refresh browser: Ctrl+Shift+R
4. Clear browser cache
```

### Email Not Sending
```
Check:
1. SMTP_PASS correct in Hostinger env vars
2. SMTP credentials valid (test in Hostinger SMTP)
3. Firewall not blocking port 465
4. Look at errors.log for details
```

### WhatsApp Webhook Failing
```
Check:
1. Webhook URL updated to HTTPS
2. Webhook URL publicly accessible
3. hub.verify_token matches in Meta Dashboard
4. Port 443 (HTTPS) open in firewall
```

### Critical Files
- `.env` - Local secrets (NEVER COMMIT)
