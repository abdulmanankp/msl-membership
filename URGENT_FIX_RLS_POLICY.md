# ⚠️ URGENT: Apply RLS Policy to Enable Member Status Updates

## The Problem
- UI shows "approved" but database doesn't update
- Database works (manual updates show in UI)
- Supabase RLS is BLOCKING admin UPDATE operations

## The Solution (Do This NOW)

### Step 1: Go to Supabase SQL Editor

1. Open: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Click **SQL Editor** in left sidebar
4. Click **New Query**

### Step 2: Copy & Paste This SQL

```sql
-- IMMEDIATELY FIX: Add RLS policy for admin UPDATE
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can update members" ON public.members;
CREATE POLICY "Admins can update members"
  ON public.members
  FOR UPDATE
  TO authenticated
  USING (public.has_role(auth.uid(), 'admin'))
  WITH CHECK (public.has_role(auth.uid(), 'admin'));

-- IMMEDIATELY FIX: Add RLS policy for admin DELETE
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can delete members" ON public.members;
CREATE POLICY "Admins can delete members"
  ON public.members
  FOR DELETE
  TO authenticated
  USING (public.has_role(auth.uid(), 'admin'));
```

### Step 3: Click **Run** 

Wait for it to complete. You should see:
```
Query executed successfully (no rows returned)
```

### Step 4: Verify Admin Role

Run this in a NEW Query:

```sql
SELECT u.email, ur.role 
FROM auth.users u
LEFT JOIN public.user_roles ur ON u.id = ur.user_id
WHERE u.email = 'admin@mslpakistan.org';
```

You should see:
```
email                          | role
admin@mslpakistan.org          | admin
```

If **role is NULL**, run this to assign it:

```sql
INSERT INTO public.user_roles (user_id, role)
SELECT id, 'admin'::app_role
FROM auth.users
WHERE email = 'admin@mslpakistan.org'
ON CONFLICT (user_id, role) DO NOTHING;
```

### Step 5: Verify Policies Are Created

Run this:

```sql
SELECT policyname, permissive, qual
FROM pg_policies
WHERE tablename = 'members'
ORDER BY policyname;
```

You should see these policies:
- ✅ Admins can delete members
- ✅ Admins can update members  
- ✅ Anyone can register as a member
- ✅ Anyone can verify members

### Step 6: Test It

1. Go back to your admin dashboard
2. Click the refresh button or reload the page (Ctrl+R)
3. Try to approve a pending member
4. Status should now change to "approved" AND stay approved after refresh ✅

---

## If It Still Doesn't Work

### Option A: Check Console for Errors
1. Open DevTools: **F12** or **Right Click → Inspect**
2. Go to **Console** tab
3. Try to approve a member again
4. Look for red errors - screenshot and share them

### Option B: Check Network Requests
1. DevTools → **Network** tab
2. Try to approve a member
3. Look for requests to `supabase.co`
4. Click on the one that failed (red)
5. Check the Response for error messages

### Option C: Verify RLS isn't Blocking

Run this SQL to see if RLS is the issue:

```sql
-- Check if policy allows admin to update
SELECT 1
FROM pg_policies
WHERE tablename = 'members' 
AND policyname = 'Admins can update members'
AND permissive = true;
```

Should return `1`. If nothing, the policy wasn't created.
